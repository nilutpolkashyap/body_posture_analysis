# Body Posture Analyzer using Mediapipe and OpenCV in Python

## About Project
Our System detects a person from a perfect side view and measures the neck and torso inclination to some reference axis. By monitoring the inclination angle when the person bends below a certain threshold angle. Other features include measuring the time of a particular posture.

Our system is deployed in a Raspberry Pi and it can be used portably as the Flask server runs on WiFi and can be connected by any smartphone or

## Software Used
- Python 3.x
